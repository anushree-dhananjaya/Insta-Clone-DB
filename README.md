# Instagram Clone Database Project

This project simulates a minimal Instagram-like system using MySQL. It includes user management, photo sharing, liking, commenting, following/unfollowing, and hashtag tagging. The project is implemented on MySQL Workbench with table schemas, SQL queries, and triggers.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following components:

1. **Table Creation and Data Insertion**: SQL script to create all required tables and insert test data.
2. **SQL Queries**: Analytical and utility queries for user engagement, leaderboard, and bot detection.
3. **Triggers**: SQL triggers to prevent self-following and to track unfollow actions.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the **table creation script** to set up the database.
2. Insert test data into the tables as required.
3. Use the provided **SQL queries** to perform analytical tasks and generate insights.
4. Deploy the **triggers** for advanced functionality like preventing self-following and tracking unfollows.

## Future Improvements

- Add stored procedures for bulk data insertion.
- Extend triggers for comment-related actions.
- Optimize queries for performance.
